A beginner-level regression project that predicts house prices using machine learning techniques. Built as part of a course to understand basic model training and evaluation using MAE.

---

## 📌 Overview

This project introduces the fundamentals of machine learning by building a model that predicts house sale prices. It walks through each stage of the ML workflow, making it perfect for those just getting started.

### ✅ Key Steps Covered:
- **🔍 Data Exploration** – Load and explore the housing dataset.
- **📊 Feature Selection** – Identify important features that impact house prices.
- **📈 Model Training** – Use `DecisionTreeRegressor` from `scikit-learn`.
- **📦 Prediction** – Predict prices using the trained model.
- **📉 Model Validation** – Evaluate accuracy using Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

## 🧾 Dataset

The project uses the **Ames Housing Dataset**, a well-known dataset for regression tasks.  
It includes **81 columns** describing various attributes of residential homes in **Ames, Iowa**.

> 🎯 **Goal:** Predict the final sale price (`SalePrice`) of each home.

## 🧠 Model Used

We use the **`DecisionTreeRegressor`** from `scikit-learn`, a simple yet effective model that:
- Learns from training data by splitting based on feature values.
- Is intuitive and easy to visualize, perfect for beginners.
- Can capture non-linear relationships in the data.
